This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open the dev server URL (printed by `npm run dev`) in your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

When deploying, configure the backend base URL as `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE` in Vercel environment variables. For local development, create a `.env.local` (copy from `.env.local.example`) and set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE=http://localhost:5000` if your backend runs on that address.
